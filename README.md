This repository contains all the materials of the course "**Standard C++ Programming**" in the **Stanford CS106L** in the semester of **fall 2025**, including the slides and my solutions of all the 7(+1) homework.

One can find the course website [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/index.html).

About the assignments, one can find the official **homework starter** repository [here](https://github.com/cs106l/cs106l-assignments). Since each term the assignments may be slightly different, if you want to get the exact same assignments as in this repository, please refer to the commit `24e6717` of the starter repository, which is the version I used in fall 2025.

Or just clink [this link](https://github.com/cs106l/cs106l-assignments/tree/24e6717339152fa1ae7ac35845a58893b6540596) to directly access fall2025-version assignments.
